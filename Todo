Drag and drop:
    Make it so that you can drag an entity on to another entity 
        this reveals a modal (hit / miss)
        If you press hit - it asks how much damage it did
        If it's a miss, well then that's a miss..
        Automatically fill in all info
    After this, move the one who's turn it is to the top

Naming:
    Be able to name enemies and players for easier tracking
    Also maybe name the players
/*    
Modals
    If you click a player, you should be able to make notes
    also see his character name and such
    (maybe the same for enemies? tracking appearance?)
*/
Create combat:
    tracks who's turn it is with an array, going through the array as combat goes on.. removing enemies that die
        when it's your turn, scroll to spells
    
    if DM - When all enemies are dead, end combat and go back to /control
    after combat maybe list up some stats (B krafa) - who did the most damage in this fight etc.
        would be done by displaying /combatEnd or something for a set amount of seconds
