Drag and drop:
    Make it so that you can drag an entity on to another entity 
        this reveals a modal (hit / miss)
        If you press hit - it asks how much damage it did
        If it's a miss, well then that's a miss..
        Automatically fill in all info
    After this, move the one who's turn it is to the top

Naming:
    Be able to name enemies and players for easier tracking
    Also maybe name the players
/*    
Modals
    If you click a player, you should be able to make notes
    also see his character name and such
    (maybe the same for enemies? tracking appearance?)
*/
Create combat:
    add initiative rolls to players, press "start combat" and go to combat screen
    tracks who's turn it is with an array, going through the array as combat goes on.. removing enemies that die
    
    When all enemies are dead, end combat and go back to /control
    after combat maybe list up some stats (B krafa) - who did the most damage in this fight etc.
        would be done by displaying /combatEnd or something for a set amount of seconds
